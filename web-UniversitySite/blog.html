                    <h2>Our Certificates & Online Program For 2022</h2>
                    <h3>Chapter 1: The boy who lived</h3>
                    <p>Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were
                        proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank
                        you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't
                        hold with such nonsense.</p><br>
                    <P>Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which
                        made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin
                        and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which
                        came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over
                        garden fences, spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small
                        son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy
                        anywhere.</P><br>
                    <p>The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a
                        secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.
                        They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about the
                        Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met
                        for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a
                        sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were
                        as unDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered
                        to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the
                        street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but
                        they had never even seen him.  This boy was another good reason
                        for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with
                        a child like that.</p><br>
                    <p>When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday
                        our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to
                        suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his
                        most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily
                        as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.</p><br>
                    <p>None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the
                        window.</p><br>
                    <p>At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked
                        Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but
                        missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing
                        his cereal at the walls. “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley as he left
                        the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four’s
                        drive.</p>
